title: Women in Privacy

The privacy market in the web3 actively lacks diversity. Women around the world actively seek privacy from domestic violence survivors protection to the right for abortion non-disclosure.

We want to kick off the educational track to bring more women into privacy x the web3: from developers to entrepreneurs. So the industry will be more diverse, open & inclusive.
